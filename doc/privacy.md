1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

In Short: We collect personal information you provide, information from connected accounts you authorize (such as a connected email inbox), information from your device and your use of the Services, and (if enabled) location and visit-related data.

A. Personal information you disclose to us
We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for an account, contact us, use the Services, or otherwise interact with us.

The personal information we collect may include:
• Name (if provided)
• Email address
• Username
• Phone number (if provided)
• Contact or authentication data (such as account credentials or tokens used to authenticate you)

Notes on credentials: If you create an account using an email/password, we collect the password in a secure, hashed form. If you authenticate through a third-party sign-in method, we collect tokens or similar authentication data associated with that method.

B. Connected email inbox data (including content)
If you connect an email inbox through an authorization method (such as Google OAuth), we may access and process email data to provide the Services. This may include:
• Email content (message body or portions of it, and snippets)
• Email metadata (such as sender/recipient, subject line, timestamps, message identifiers, labels/folders, and header information)
• Attachment content or attachment metadata, if and only if required to support a feature you use

Email content may include information about other people. Please avoid connecting accounts or processing emails that you do not have the right to use.

C. Location and visit-related data (including third-party SDK collection)
If you enable location permissions, we may collect and process location data to provide and improve the Services. Depending on your device and settings, this can include precise or approximate location.

We also use a third-party software development kit (“Location/Visit Measurement SDK”) to help collect and process signals that can support location/visit-related measurement and related service operations. Depending on your device settings and permissions, this SDK may collect and transmit the following types of data:
• Device latitude/longitude and associated timestamps
• Wi‑Fi scan data and/or Bluetooth/beacon scan data (as available on your device and permitted by your settings)
• Unique identifiers such as an install identifier and/or an app-specific “consumer” identifier
• Advertising identifier (such as IDFA/AAID) and your device’s advertising tracking preference/opt‑out setting
• Basic device information (such as battery status, device model, and operating system/version)

This SDK may operate in the background when permitted by your device settings and permissions. We use the information from this SDK for purposes such as supporting location/visit-related measurement, improving reliability, preventing fraud/abuse, and operating and improving the Services. We do not use connected inbox data for advertising.

D. Information automatically collected (device, log, and usage data)
We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not necessarily reveal your specific identity but may include device and usage information, such as:
• IP address
• Device identifiers and app instance identifiers
• Device type, model, and operating system
• Browser type (for the website)
• Language preferences
• Referring URLs
• Dates/times of access
• Diagnostic and performance data (including crash logs)

E. Push notifications
If you opt in, we may send push notifications related to your account or app functionality. You can turn these off in your device settings.

2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We process your information to provide and administer the Services, enable AI-assisted processing you request, support user feedback and troubleshooting, maintain security, and comply with law.

We may process personal information for purposes including:
• Providing, operating, and maintaining the Services

• Responding to inquiries and providing customer support
• Monitoring for security incidents, preventing fraud/abuse, and enforcing our policies
• Analytics and performance monitoring (including debugging and crash analysis)
• Complying with legal obligations and responding to lawful requests

We do not sell personal information. We do not use connected inbox data for advertising, including targeted advertising.

3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

In Short: We process personal information only when we have a valid legal basis under applicable law.

Depending on where you live and the context, we may rely on one or more of the following legal bases:
• Consent (for example, where you enable permissions or connect a third-party account)
• Performance of a contract (to provide the Services you request)
• Legitimate interests (such as to maintain and improve the Services, prevent fraud, and secure our systems), where permitted by law
• Legal obligations (to comply with applicable laws and lawful requests)
• Vital interests (to protect safety in urgent circumstances)

4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

In Short: We may share personal information with service providers that help us operate the Services, for legal compliance, and in connection with business transfers.

• Cloud hosting and infrastructure providers
• AI processing providers (for AI-assisted features)
• Analytics, monitoring, and customer support tools
• Location/visit measurement SDK providers

These providers are authorized to process personal information only as needed to provide services to us and subject to contractual obligations.

B. Business transfers
We may share or transfer information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, financing, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of all or a portion of our business or assets.

C. Legal and safety reasons
We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency), or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect rights, safety, and security, investigate fraud, or respond to abuse.

D. With your direction
We may share information when you direct us to do so or where you provide consent.

5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

In Short: We use cookies and similar technologies primarily for security, functionality, and analytics.

We may use cookies and similar technologies on our website to:
• Keep you signed in and maintain preferences

We may also use SDKs within the mobile app for analytics, crash reporting, and location/visit measurement as described above.

We do not use connected inbox data for advertising. We do not sell personal information.

6. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?

In Short: We use AI/ML technologies to process inputs (including connected inbox data and, if enabled, location/visit-related context) and generate outputs within the Services.

AI-assisted processing
We may use AI and machine-learning technologies to provide certain parts of the Services. To do this, we may send limited inputs (which may include portions of email content and/or location context) to third-party AI processing providers and receive outputs back.

Data minimization and protections
We aim to share only the information reasonably necessary for the requested processing. We use contractual and technical measures designed to require service providers to protect personal information and to process it only for providing services to Wayd.

Human access restrictions
We restrict employee access to connected inbox content. We do not routinely review the contents of connected inboxes. Access is limited to authorized personnel for purposes such as customer support, security, troubleshooting, and legal compliance, subject to access controls and logging.

7. GOOGLE API DISCLOSURES

8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?

In Short: We may transfer, store, and process information in countries other than your own.

Our servers are located in the United States. Our service providers may process information in the United States and other countries where they operate. Where required by law, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.

9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

We retain personal information only as long as reasonably necessary to:
• Provide the Services
• Maintain security and prevent fraud
• Resolve disputes and enforce agreements
• Comply with legal obligations

Connected inbox data (including email content) may be retained to operate the Services, associate feedback with relevant processing, and support troubleshooting and service integrity. We delete or de-identify personal information when it is no longer needed, subject to limited backup retention and legal requirements.

10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

In Short: We implement reasonable security measures designed to protect personal information.

We have implemented technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature. Because there is not yet a common standard for DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time. If standards are adopted in the future that we must follow, we will update this notice.
