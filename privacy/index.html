                        depending on how you use the Services, including account information, connected email inbox data
                        (including email content and metadata), location and visit-related data (if enabled), and
                        device/usage information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do we process any sensitive personal information?</strong> Depending on where you live,
                        precise location and the contents of communications (including emails) may be considered

                    <li><strong>Do we collect any information from third parties?</strong> Yes. If you connect a
                        third-party account (such as an email inbox), we receive information from that provider at your
                        direction. We also receive certain data from service providers that help us operate the Services
                        (such as infrastructure, analytics, and location/visit measurement).</li>
                    <li><strong>How do we process your information?</strong> We process information to provide and

                    <li><strong>In what situations and with which parties do we share personal information?</strong> We
                        may share personal information with service providers that process data on our behalf (such as
                        hosting, AI processing providers, and location/visit measurement SDK providers), for legal
                        compliance, and in connection with business transfers.</li>
                    <li><strong>How do we keep your information safe?</strong> We implement reasonable technical and
                        organizational measures designed to protect personal information. No system is 100% secure.</li>
                    <li><strong>What are your rights?</strong> Depending on your location, you may have rights to

                <h2 id="info-collect">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
                <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We collect personal information you provide, information from connected
                    accounts you authorize (such as a connected email inbox), information from your device and your use
                    of the Services, and (if enabled) location and visit-related data.</p>

                <h3>A. Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
                <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for an account,
                    contact us, use the Services, or otherwise interact with us.</p>
                <p>The personal information we collect may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name (if provided)</li>
                    <li>Email address</li>
                    <li>Username</li>
                    <li>Phone number (if provided)</li>
                    <li>Contact or authentication data (such as account credentials or tokens used to authenticate you)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Notes on credentials:</strong> If you create an account using an email/password, we collect
                    the password in a secure, hashed form. If you authenticate through a third-party sign-in method, we
                    collect tokens or similar authentication data associated with that method.</p>

                <h3>B. Connected email inbox data (including content)</h3>
                <p>If you connect an email inbox through an authorization method (such as Google OAuth), we may access
                    and process email data to provide the Services. This may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email content (message body or portions of it, and snippets)</li>
                    <li>Email metadata (such as sender/recipient, subject line, timestamps, message identifiers,
                        labels/folders, and header information)</li>
                    <li>Attachment content or attachment metadata, if and only if required to support a feature you use
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Email content may include information about other people. Please avoid connecting accounts or
                    processing emails that you do not have the right to use.</p>

                <h3>C. Location and visit-related data (including third-party SDK collection)</h3>
                <p>If you enable location permissions, we may collect and process location data to provide and improve
                    the Services. Depending on your device and settings, this can include precise or approximate
                    location.</p>
                <p>We also use a third-party software development kit (“Location/Visit Measurement SDK”) to help collect
                    and process signals that can support location/visit-related measurement and related service
                    operations. Depending on your device settings and permissions, this SDK may collect and transmit the
                    following types of data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device latitude/longitude and associated timestamps</li>
                    <li>Wi‑Fi scan data and/or Bluetooth/beacon scan data (as available on your device and permitted by
                        your settings)</li>
                    <li>Unique identifiers such as an install identifier and/or an app-specific “consumer” identifier
                    </li>
                    <li>Advertising identifier (such as IDFA/AAID) and your device’s advertising tracking
                        preference/opt‑out setting</li>
                    <li>Basic device information (such as battery status, device model, and operating system/version)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This SDK may operate in the background when permitted by your device settings and permissions. We use
                    the information from this SDK for purposes such as supporting location/visit-related measurement,
                    improving reliability, preventing fraud/abuse, and operating and improving the Services. We do not
                    use connected inbox data for advertising.</p>

                <h3>D. Information automatically collected (device, log, and usage data)</h3>
                <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This
                    information does not necessarily reveal your specific identity but may include device and usage
                    information, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                    <li>Device identifiers and app instance identifiers</li>
                    <li>Device type, model, and operating system</li>
                    <li>Browser type (for the website)</li>
                    <li>Language preferences</li>
                    <li>Referring URLs</li>
                    <li>Dates/times of access</li>
                    <li>Diagnostic and performance data (including crash logs)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>E. Push notifications</h3>
                <p>If you opt in, we may send push notifications related to your account or app functionality. You can
                    turn these off in your device settings.</p>

                <h2 id="how-process">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
                <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information to provide and administer the Services, enable
                    AI-assisted processing you request, support user feedback and troubleshooting, maintain security,
                    and comply with law.</p>
                <p>We may process personal information for purposes including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining the Services</li>
                    <li>Authenticating users and managing accounts</li>
                    <li>Processing connected inbox data and location/visit-related data to generate outputs within the
                        Services</li>
                    <li>Associating user feedback with relevant inputs/outputs to improve reliability, troubleshoot
                        issues, and support service quality</li>

                <h3>A. Service providers (processors)</h3>

                    authorities (e.g., a court or government agency), or where we believe disclosure is necessary to
                    protect rights, safety, and security, investigate fraud, or respond to abuse.</p>

                <h3>D. With your direction</h3>

                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature. Because
