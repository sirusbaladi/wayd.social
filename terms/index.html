                <h2 id="disputes">17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
                <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
                <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute"), the parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other.</p>

                <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p>If the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>
                <p>The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"). Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If the arbitrator determines such costs are excessive, we will pay arbitration fees and expenses as required by the AAA Consumer Rules.</p>
                <p>The arbitration may be conducted in person, through submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Unless required otherwise, the arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, California.</p>

                <h3>Time Limit</h3>
                <p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose, unless applicable law requires a longer period.</p>

                <h3>Restrictions</h3>
                <p>The parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the parties individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law:<br>
                (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;<br>
                (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and<br>
                (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>

                <h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>
                <p>The following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions: (a) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect intellectual property rights; (b) any Dispute related to allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
                <p>If any portion of this Dispute Resolution section is found unlawful or unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be severed and the remainder will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
